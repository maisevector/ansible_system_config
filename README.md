# Personal debian playbook

This playbook configures my personal computer with the usual suspects.

There is also a substantial part of configuring both the `gnome` desktop
environment and the `sway` window manager.

The configuration files will be linked to their locations, so this playbook not
only takes care of installing system packages, but also acts as a dotfile
manager.
